# Generate one operation-level test file

Generate one operation-level test file

## Usage

``` r
.generate_paths_test_file(
  path_operation,
  operation_id,
  api_abbr,
  use_prefix = FALSE,
  pkg_dir = "."
)
```

## Arguments

- path_operation:

  (`list`) Template data for one operation.

- operation_id:

  (`character(1)`) The operation identifier used in generated file
  names.

- api_abbr:

  named `{api_abbr}_{operation_id}` and `req_{api_abbr}_{operation_id}`.
