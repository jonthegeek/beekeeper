# Shared parameters

These parameters are used in multiple functions. They are defined here
to make them easier to import and to find.

## Arguments

- addition:

  (`character`) Text to append when `test` is `TRUE`.

- allow_empty:

  (`logical`) Whether empty parameter values may be represented as
  `NULL`.

- api_abbr:

  (`character(1)`) A short (about 2-5 letter) abbreviation for the API,
  for use in function names and environment variables.

- api_definition:

  ([`rapid::class_rapid`](https://rapid.api2r.org/reference/class_rapid.html))
  The API definition to generate package code from.

- api_title:

  (`character(1)`) The API title used in generated package files.

- base_path:

  The root URL of the current project.

- base_url:

  (`character(1)`) The base URL used in generated test helpers.

- call:

  (`environment`) The caller environment for error messages.

- config:

  (`list`) Package-generation configuration data.

- config_filename:

  (`character(1)` or `fs_path`) The path to a beekeeper yaml config file
  (relative to the package root).

  (`character(1)`) The directory where a generated file should be
  written.

- endpoint:

  (`character(1)`) The operation endpoint.

- endpoints:

  (`character`) Endpoint paths paired with operations.

- exclude_from_response:

  (`character`) Field names to remove from response specs before
  generating parsers. Fields matching these names will be dropped from
  the response spec. If only one field remains after exclusion and it is
  of type `"df"`, `"row"`, or `"recursive"`, the spec is simplified so
  that the response parser targets that field directly.

- filter_in:

  (`character(1)`) The parameter location to keep.

  (`character`) HTTP methods paired with endpoints.

- operation:

  (`character(1)`) The HTTP method.

- operation_description:

  (`character(1)`) The operation description.

- operation_descriptions:

  (`character`) Operation descriptions from the API definition.

- operation_id:

  (`character(1)`) The operation identifier used in generated file
  names.

- operation_ids:

  (`character`) Operation identifiers from the API definition.

- operation_summaries:

  (`character`) Operation summaries from the API definition.

- operation_summary:

  (`character(1)`) The operation summary.

- original:

  (`character`) The original text.

- pagination_data:

  (`list`) Pagination metadata used while generating path files.

- parameters:

  (`data.frame`) Operation parameters.

- params:

  (`list`) Parameter metadata for a single operation.

- params_df:

  (`data.frame`) Parameter metadata in tabular form.

- params_schema:

  (`data.frame`) Schema metadata for operation parameters.

- path:

  (`character(1)`) The path template.

- path_operation:

  (`list`) Template data for one operation.

- paths:

  ([`rapid::class_paths`](https://rapid.api2r.org/reference/class_paths.html))
  API path definitions.

- paths_by_operation:

  (`list`) Template-ready operations keyed by operation identifier.

- pkg_dir:

  (`character(1)` or `fs_path`) The directory containing package files.

- rapid_filename:

  (`character(1)` or `fs_path`) The path to the R API definition (rapid)
  file (relative to the package root).

- required:

  (`logical`) Whether each parameter is required.

- save_security_data:

  (`logical(1)`) Whether to save generated security metadata to a file
  and record that file in the beekeeper config.

- security_arg_description:

  (`character(1)`) The argument description.

- security_arg_name:

  (`character(1)`) The argument name.

- security_arg_names:

  (`character`) Security argument names to exclude from generated
  operation signatures (because they are defined once, separately).

- security_args:

  (`character`) Security argument names to remove from operation
  parameters (because they are defined once, separately).

- security_data:

  (`list`) Generated security metadata.

- security_scheme_collection:

  (`list`) Collected security scheme metadata.

- security_scheme_description:

  (`character(1)`) A security scheme description from the API
  definition.

- security_scheme_details:

  ([`rapid::class_security_scheme_details`](https://rapid.api2r.org/reference/class_security_scheme_details.html))
  The security scheme details.

- security_scheme_name:

  (`character(1)`) The security scheme name.

- security_scheme_type:

  (`character(1)`) The security scheme type.

- security_schemes:

  ([`rapid::class_security_schemes`](https://rapid.api2r.org/reference/class_security_schemes.html))
  Security schemes from the API definition.

- security_data_filename:

  (`character(1)` or `fs_path`) The path to the saved security metadata
  file (relative to the package root).

- tag_operations:

  (`list`) Operations grouped under one tag.

- tag_name:

  (`character(1)`) The tag name.

- tags:

  (`character` or `list`) Tags for all operations.

- target:

  (`character(1)`) The name of the generated file.

- template:

  (`character(1)`) The template file name to render.

- test:

  (`logical`) A condition for each element of `original`.

- use_prefix:

  (`logical(1)`) Whether to include `api_abbr` as a prefix in generated
  path function names. When `FALSE` (the default), functions are named
  `{operation_id}` and `req_{operation_id}`. When `TRUE`, functions are
  named `{api_abbr}_{operation_id}` and `req_{api_abbr}_{operation_id}`.

- to_collapse:

  (`character`) The character vector to collapse.

- type:

  (`data.frame`) Joined parameter type metadata.
